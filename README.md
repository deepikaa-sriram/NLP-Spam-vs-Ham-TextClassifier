# Spam vs. Ham Text Classifier Model
In this project, I created a spam vs ham text classifier by developing a model to distinguish between spam messages and ham messages. Spam messages refer to unsolicited and unwanted messages, typically promoting products, services, or containing fraudulent content, while ham messages are legitimate and non-spam messages.

The classifier aims to accurately categorize incoming messages as either spam or ham, enabling efficient filtering and identification of unwanted messages in various communication platforms like email, text messaging, or social media.
